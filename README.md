ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Purpose: 

The project's goal is to create an accessible and easy-to-use educational tool powered by a large language model. It aims to simplify the process of learning by providing on-demand explanations and practice quizzes for any given topic.

Audience: 

The target audience includes students, teachers, researchers, and anyone looking for a quick and interactive way to learn or study.

ðŸš€ Features


Concept Explanations:

 Users can input a topic and receive a detailed, human-like explanation with examples, which is generated by the AI model in real time.


Quiz Generation: 

The assistant can automatically generate a quiz with five questions covering a given topic, using a variety of formats like multiple choice, true/false, and short answer. It also provides a separate answer key for self-assessment.


Interactive Interface: 

The web-based user interface, built with Gradio, provides a simple, clean layout with separate tabs for each function, making it intuitive to use.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack


Programming Language:

 
The entire application is written in Python.

Libraries: 

The core of the tech stack includes:

Gradio: 

Used to create the web-based user interface with just a few lines of Python code, eliminating the need for complex frontend development.

Transformers (Hugging Face): 

This library is essential for loading and utilizing the pre-trained language model and its tokenizer.

PyTorch: 

The deep learning framework used to handle the model's computations, especially for GPU acceleration.

Model: 

The intelligence is powered by the ibm-granite/granite-3.2-2b-instruct model, an open-source, instruction-tuned AI from IBM that is efficient and good at following commands.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Single File (.py): 

The entire application is contained within a single Python script.

Modular Functions: 

The code is organized into distinct functions for each task: generate_response (core AI interaction), concept_explanation (prompting for an explanation), and quiz_generator (prompting for a quiz).


Gradio Blocks: 


The UI is structured using gr.Blocks, which allows for a multi-tab layout and connects the user interface components (textboxes, buttons) to the Python functions.
